## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup000;

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to center a div :).
- I learned how to add box-shadow to an element.
- To center a text verticaly, there is no need for flexbox as line-height is sufficient.
- I learned how to crop to circle.

### Continued development
